                  <p style="font-weight:bold;">■KNOWN ISSUES</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                     ・<strong>Some units' visual effect are unintentionally adjusted.</strong><br>
                     <strong>=> Will be fixed in the future.</strong><br>
                     <br>
                     ・Floor Clearing Events and its variants are unplayable.<br>
                     => We actually found the solution for this issue, however it requires a lot of time to fix them. We will try to fix normal FCEs as soon as possible.<br>
                     <br>
                     ・Guild Events and its variants require guild to play.<br>
                     => This is likely to be a feature, no fix for this one.<br>
                     <br>
                     ・The game sometimes has no sound.<br>
                     => Force close all background sounds before opening the game. This is the issue from online version so it is unlikely to be fixed.<br>
                     <br>
                     ・A black screen appears after "Link Start" screen and you can still tap in the game.<br>
                     => Restart the game. This is a glitch from the vanilla offline version.<br>
                  </p>
