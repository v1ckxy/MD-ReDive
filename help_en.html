                  <p style="font-weight:bold;">■KNOWN ISSUES</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                     <strong>・The .apk can't be installed on some devices.</strong><br>
                     <strong>=> We will fix it by releasing a new .apks in several days. For now, just install the .apks we provided and be expected to encounter some bugs there. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!</strong><br>
                     <strong>ㅤ	(The .apk maker note: I am really sorry for the inconvenience, it just worked fine on both of my devices so I can't really find the issue here.)</strong><br>
                     <br>
                     ・Floor Clearing Events and its variants are unplayable.<br>
                     => We actually found the solution for this issue, however it requires a lot of time to fix them. We will try to fix normal FCEs as soon as possible.<br>
                     <br>
                     ・Guild Events and its variants require guild to play.<br>
                     => This is likely to be a feature, no fix for this one.<br>
                     <br>
                     ・The game sometimes has no sound.<br>
                     => Force close all background sounds before opening the game. This is the issue from online version so it is unlikely to be fixed.<br>
                     <br>
                     ・A black screen appears after "Link Start" screen and you can still tap in the game.<br>
                     => Restart the game. This is a glitch from the vanilla offline version.<br>
